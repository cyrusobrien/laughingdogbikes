# Winter hours and time off

For the month of January we’ll be open slightly limited hours: Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5pm. Send us an email at info@laughingdogbicycles.com if you need us outside of those times and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

In addition, we’ll be taking a little break in the middle of January. The shop will be CLOSED from January 15th to 22nd, reopening 1/23/25.

Happy new year, and remember, winter is a great time to get your bike overhauled for spring riding or bring us that dusty project you’ve been putting off!

The entry to the southernmost alley is just south of 79 S. Pleasant Street, a large white building with a large cupola. The entrance is 3m south of a covered bus stop.
