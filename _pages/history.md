## Max

Max the dog, used as our logo, belonged to Parker, the shop owner. Max was a border collie mutt rescued from the Springfield Animal Shelter by Parker’s friend at college. He was brilliant and although identified in the picture as a high-profile canine wanderer, Max actually crossed the road at designated intersections and waited for the pedestrian signal. He evaded the dog catcher twice by moving to a nearby porch and pretending to live at the house. Max could be seen in the 80s and early 90s walking downtown with a full popover in his mouth, courtesy of his friend’s at Judy’s restaurant.
