![domane]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/domane.jpeg){: class="floatpic"}

## Trek

### Trek Domane

We carry many models from Trek’s Domane Line. The Domane line is designed around endurance road riding, with a more comfortable fit and room for wider tires to soak up more of the road. We like them for riding all over the valley, and taking the buzz out of some of our “less maintained” roads. Higher end bikes from this line come with rough road dampening features integrated into the frame. They start at $800 and go up in price from there, and you really couldn’t go wrong with any of them!

![emonda]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/emonda.jpeg){: class="floatpic"}

### Trek Emonda 

Trek’s Emonda line is all about being as light and quick as possible. It is available in Aluminum and Carbon fiber, with disc or rim brakes. With models starting at $1400, they have great model options for getting into road racing, and in the high end, furthering your racing career.
